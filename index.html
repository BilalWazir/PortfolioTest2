          <p>Building this website has been a truly rewarding experience for me. When I first started out, I wasn't sure how to approach the project or what to include in my portfolio. But as I began to gather my thoughts and ideas, the structure of the website started to take shape. I knew I wanted it to showcase my skills, interests, and projects while also making it user-friendly and visually appealing.</p>
          <p>Throughout the process, I learned a lot about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I experimented with different design elements, such as gradients, animations, and hover effects. It took a bit of trial and error to get things just right, but with each adjustment, the website became better and more refined. One challenge I faced was making sure the site was responsive and looked good on mobile devices as well. I had to tweak some CSS properties to ensure the content was properly displayed on smaller screens.</p>
          <p>Majority of the assistance in the creation of this portfolio came from the direction and guidance of my tutor, Mr. Michael Borck. other availible resources include ChatGPT, W3CSchools, Google and etc. Initially my first webpage got to nearcompletion but ended up not working as i didnt have direction and didnt like the design, this page is the second version i started from scratch that i kept simple and love it</p>
          <p>I also had some fun adding my projects to the site. Figuring out how to display them with images and descriptions was an interesting task. I wanted the projects to be easily accessible, so I added links that launch the applications directly. This way, visitors can explore my work and get a feel for what I can do.</p>
          <p>Creating the reflection section was a great opportunity to look back on my journey and take stock of what I've learned. Writing this reflection has made me realize just how much I've grown as a developer and how much I enjoy creating web experiences. I'm excited to continue learning and improving my skills, and I can't wait to see where this journey takes me next!</p>
